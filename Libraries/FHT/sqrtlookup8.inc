 sqrt lookup table for 16b unsigned input values
 returns an 8b unsigned value
 this table is optimized for the fft program
 as the max value the sum of 2 squares can return is $8000
 so the top half is truncated off
 and then it is stretched to return 0 - 255
 the table is allocated as follows
 table0 : $000 -> $0ff : sqrt($0000 -> $00ff)
 table2 : $100 -> $17f : sqrt($0100 -> $0fff)
 table1 : $180 -> $27f : sqrt($1000 -> $7fff)

 its hacked to compensate for the $8000 problem

 sample code for doing the lookup table - not tested
 assumes data in z register

 cpi zh,$10
 brsh table2
 cpi zh,$01
 brsh table1
 rjmp done

 table2:

 lsl zl
 rol zh
 mov zl,zh
 ldi zh,$01
 rjmp done

 table1:

 swap zh
 swap zl
 andi zl,$0f
 or zl,zh
 lsr zl
 ldi zh,$02

 done:

 lpm r16,z
